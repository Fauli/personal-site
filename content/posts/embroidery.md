# Embroidery

My journey making various embroideries

<img src=".attachements/sloth-sowing.webp" width="250"> <!-- Adjust width as needed -->


## Machine

I'm using an Bernette b79. I like the model and can recommend it. However, my interactions with sowing machines are limited, so I dont have a lot of comparison :)
But the machine works pretty great overall.

## Tooling

I've tried two tools so far, [StichBuddy](https://www.stitchbuddy.de/) on Mac and Inkscape with the [inkstick](https://inkstitch.org/) plugin.

| Feature                    | StitchBuddy                                                      | Inkscape with Ink/Stitch Plugin                                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Platform**               | macOS                                                            | Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)                                                                         |
| **Primary Use**            | Editing and managing embroidery files                            | Vector graphics editor with embroidery plugin                                                                  |
| **File Formats Supported** | Common embroidery formats like PES, DST                          | Supports SVG natively; embroidery formats via plugin                                                           |
| **Editing Capabilities**   | Basic editing, such as resize, rotate, flip, change colors       | Extensive vector editing, plus embroidery-specific features like stitch direction, and density                 |
| **Cost**                   | Free version with limited features; full version paid <br /> StitchBuddy Pro via In-App purchase removes saving limitation to 1,000 stitches (USD 49.99)            | Free (open-source)                                                                                             |
| **User Interface**         | Tailored for embroidery editing with a straightforward interface | Complex, suitable for advanced users familiar with vector graphics                                             |
| **Additional Features**    | Realistic 3D preview, thread color management, print templates   | Broad capabilities for graphic design; advanced embroidery features like auto-fill, and custom stitch patterns |

Because Inkscape so far covered my needs, I'm using it for now.

## Workflows

### Get pre-created embroidery designs

There are various pages where you can get pre-made designs, so far I only used  [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/market/machine_embroidery_designs). 
The design I got there worked well and looked nice.


### Creating own embroidery from image

You must have the [inkstitch plugin installed ](https://inkstitch.org/docs/install-macos/).

I'm using this image as starting point: [sloth-head.svg](.attachments/sloth-head.svg).
 
1. Open the file in Inkscape (it has to be SVG, maybe you need to [convert](https://retouchinglabs.com/inkscape-convert-png-to-svg/) it)
1. Click on "Extensions -> Ink/Stitch -> Params"
1. Wait for the param config to run through
1. Play around with the settings, so you like them
1. Hit apply and quit to return to the main screen
1. Click "File -> Save as.."
1. In the file type, select i.e. PES or EXP depending on your machine, I'm using PES
1. Save the file and copy it to USB

The output file is: [sloth-head.pes](.attachments/sloth-head.pes)

An advanced version can be found here [sloth-head-colored.svg](.attachments/sloth-head-colored.svg).
With the created file as well: [sloth-head-colored.pes](.attachments/sloth-head-colored.pes)


## Working params

The Bernette b79 comes with 3 stitching hoops and hoop recognition. Use the smallest one that suits your need.
